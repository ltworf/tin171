CHANGELOG

0.4
- Better enabling/disabling buttons
- Can add multiple bots at the same time
- Fixes very odd bug that caused bots to crash when they were emitting too much 
  output (by redirecting their output to /dev/null if they are started within
  the GUI).
- Removed imports from erlang code. New erlang version doesn't like them.

0.3
- More notifications
- A bit more explicative UI

0.2
- Fix makefile to build the server

0.1
- Initial release
